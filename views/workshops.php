Additionally, I would like to talk about the importance of financial literacy.</p>

This workshop is to generate more awareness of the indigenous groups that are currently residing in Vietnam from the Vietnam Census, and learn about their stories, histories, as well as the problems they are facing today and brainstorming solutions for that.

In lonely desolating times like these, one way to escape our world was to jump into another. More specifically into the world of Asian dramas! From c-dramas, k-dramas, jdramas, v-dramas, and Thai dramas, you could fall in love with wig-wearing wuxia heroes to lonely, rich son of a CEO to the female lead who's the reincarnation of a past lover to opera folktale singer with an identity crisis to a BL ship. This workshop is for drama newbies and lovers alike! Come meet friends in the Asian drama fandom community, discuss how dramas can soothe your mental health during a pandemic, and play a game of speed dating with dramas from different Asian cultures. You might find your ultimate Asian drama match!</p>

              <p class="card-text">Many of us who identify as a visible minority would have faced some form of racism at least once in our lives. Those who identify as a woman may experience sexism as well. While some of these unfortunate experiences are blatant, we do not typically take the time to stop and think about its subtler form, microaggressions. These intentional or unintentional negative slights play a big part in the hidden daily struggle that minorities and women face. This workshop hopes to bring attention to understanding how instances of microaggressions happen in day-to-day life and how we can work to reduce or avoid the use of microaggressions.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This past year, the country faced a long-overdue racial reckoning that resulted in a worldwide protest in support of Black lives and against police brutality. For many, understanding the country's history of racial violence, especially against Black people, may be new. This workshop will identify the many ways racism is perpetuated against Black people, and address topics such as White Privilege, Reverse Racism, African American Vernacular English/Black Vernacular English, Digital Blackface, anti-Blackness in the Asian American community, examples of solidarity between the two communities, and how Asian Americans can be allies to the Black community. Please note: this workshop is intended to serve as an introduction to the topics of anti-Black racism, specifically individuals who are new/not as knowledgeable about the topic. If you already have a strong understanding of institutional and systemic racism, this may not be a beneficial workshop for you. However, you are still more than welcome to join!</p>

The Asian American young woman who pulls all nighters for work or assignments, misses meals because she is simply glued to her desk and can't get away, has an itemized color-coded calendar full of meetings, events, and extracurriculars, and looks like she has it all together as she moves up the social and economic ladder. Looking at her, it seems the harder you work, the more successful you are. But the reality is far harsher: she's not life goals. She's unhealthy, a workaholic, and probably has crumbling mental health as she fights to prove she's good enough in a predominantly white male society. This workshop aims to dismantle the trope of the AAPI girlboss by unpacking the effects of the model minority and meritocracy myth on young AAPI women. Come for roasting the racist capitalist patriarchy and sharing tips and tricks on taking care of our bodies and mind!</p>
